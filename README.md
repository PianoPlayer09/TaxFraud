# TaxFraud
This Github is a compilation of all my work on TaxFraud and creating a model to try to simulate catching Fraudulent expenses being entered
In this project, due to the lack of data available in the public, we created some of our own fraudalanet data and use GANs to try to simulate more data
We prepared data in Tabular Format for the different ML models.
This project is still WIP, here are some of the data we have come out with:
